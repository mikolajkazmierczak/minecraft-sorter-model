A Minecraft resource sorting system simulation analyzing optimal sorter-dispencer ratios. Includes Python-based simulation, statistical validation, and in-game testing results. Demonstrates scalability and efficiency trade-offs in automated farms.

This was a task for a course on computer simulation. The collected data was later used for a report.
